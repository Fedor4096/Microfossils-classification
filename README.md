Research on the potential application of machine learning in the task of identifying the biological species of a fossil from its image captured by an electron microscope.

<h3>Solved tasks:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Assessment of the required number of images for training the model.</li>
  <li>Investigation of the impact of the sample's preservation quality in the image on the predictive ability of the created model.</li>
  <li>Determination of the minimum system requirements for the operation of both the developed algorithm and similar neural network-based solutions.</li>
</ul>

The project was implemented using convolutional neural networks and the functionality of the TensorFlow library. Transfer learning was employed for training the convolutional layers.
